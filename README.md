  <summary>Things to note</summary>

  I used an old project of mine as a boilerplate. I struggled with the newer version a little.
  Please don't mind the "kwikBite" and some libs that might not be of use:]
  ### What I still need to do
  1. Path resolution
  2. Fix unit tests
  3. Move code to a new clean repo / Do the renaming process
   
  ### There are sections I would have done differently, but could not due to time constraints
  - Use localisation for strings and possible translation
