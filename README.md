# ðŸš€ React Native Investec Assessment - October 2022

This project is uses react navigation, redux, redux logger, redux persist and redux saga,
as well as a bit of theming with react-native-paper. 


## How to get started

1. Clone reposotory

  <summary>Things to note</summary>

  ### What I still need to do
  1. Path resolution
  2. Unit tests
   


  ### There are sections I would have done differently, but could not due to time constraints

  - Create a central location for all colors used thoroughout the app, similar
    to what I did for the theming with the `theme-config.ts` file
  - The ButtonGroup could have also imported the various butttons from their own  locations 
  - Create a single file with key, value pairs which will contain all the strings used across the app, makes it easier to add in translations
